// read in pgm file
// put it into a bit2
// create a new bit2
// go through the bit2 row-major --> check each lines --> turn the black
//      edges into 2
// go though the bit2 col-major --> check if there are any 1 neighboring 2s
//      --> turn that into 2
// go through the whole bit2 overwriting 2s as 0s
